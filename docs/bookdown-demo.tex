\chapter{Motivation}\label{motivation}}

As machine learning (ML) has become a powerful tool, it is noted by some that ML has not been widely used in environmental studies. This booklet is meant to provide a concise guide for natural resource management practitioners. This book serves as a staring point rather than a comprehensive resource, so that practitioners can have a basic understanding of how ML works and how to utilize it to analyze data and answer research questions. When appropriate, we provide case studies and R code as well as other online resources to help the readers on the journey of gaining one powerful tool that seems to be omnipresent in the research world.

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

What is machine learning? Essentially, machine learning teaches computer models to look for patterns or make predictions. This might sound like magic or it might seem complicated, but you can think of machine learning models as finding underlying formulas that the data come from. To solve for such formula, many, many mathematical calculations are involved. As we human beings are prone to mistakes, as long as we can identify a framework, we can give the framework and data to a computer model. It is best at repeating meticulous calculations to find a best guess based on our believes of the system and the data we observed.

One could argue that data is the single most important ingredient when it comes to machine learning models or any type of analysis. As one might say, junk in, junk out.

We should first address the concepts of training and testing.

\hypertarget{cross-validation}{%
\section{Cross Validation}\label{cross-validation}}

One very standard way of evaluation is \(k\)-fold cross validation, commonly with \(k=5\) or \(k=10\). The idea is simple. Divide the data into \(k\) groups. Each time, choose \(k-1\) groups for training, fit the model on the last group, which is the test data, and calculate the desired metrics, such as MSE.

In this way, although less data is used for training, the metrics are more accurate, because now we are not using the same data points for training and testing. Using metrics from cross validation for model selection can ensure that your model does not overfit, which means the model does well with training data but does not generalize well on new data.

Here we provide a list of commonly used machine learning methods and some brief discussion.

It is also important to present the results in a way that aids rather than impede communication.

\section{Reproducibility}\label{reproducibility}}

To allow for others to reproduce your work, it is important to provide enough details in terms of methods, data processing, code implementation, etc. It is also encouraged to have all the code and data available online in a repository. If parts or all of the data should not be shared publicly, it helps to provide a simulated data set.
