# Some words first  

This booklet is meant to provide guidelines for natural resource management practitioners.


```{r eval=FALSE, include = FALSE}
# This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
# The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```



```{r include=FALSE}
# Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

# To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
