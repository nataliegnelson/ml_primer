# Ethical Considerations  

## Reproducibility  

To allow for others to reproduce your work, it is important to provide enough details in terms of methods, data processing, code implementation, etc. It is also encouraged to have all the code and data available online in a repository. If parts or all of the data should not be shared publicly, it helps to provide a simulated data set.
